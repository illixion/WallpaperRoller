## What is Wallpaper Roller?

This is a XenHTML background that will randomly rotate through your wallpapers on a regular schedule. You can use any images, GIFs or even MP4 videos, and Wallpaper Roller will show them on your lock screen and/or home screen automatically. It's even got support for downloading images from Danbooru-based image boards! Documentation can be found [here](https://jb.catto.io/depictions/web/?p=io.catto.wallpaperroller).

I've made this background because there were no better alternatives available. The only ones that I could find either didn't work or used iOS features that would break with every major iOS update. Wallpaper Roller only depends on XenHTML, and thus it will continue to work for as long as XenHTML is still supported.

## Will this drain my battery?

This background only runs for a fraction of a second whenever it becomes visible, going into a paused state immediately afterwards, which means that it uses almost no power. You're welcome.

## Where can I download Wallpaper Roller?

It's now available for the price of **FREE** on my repository: <https://jb.catto.io>

Dependencies: [XenHTML](https://xenpublic.incendo.ws/)

I've put a lot of work into turning this hobby project into something that everybody could enjoy, so please consider supporting me on Ko-Fi: <https://ko-fi.com/manual>
